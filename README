The HTML form of the VOTable document is currently built from the LaTeX
sources using cgiprint, a tool developed at CDS by Francois Ochsenbein.

*NOTE* that cgprint is a one-pass tool and does not handle crossreferencing.
Any references in the (HTML) text to numbered sections need to be hard coded. 
Therefore, if you change the document structure (e.g. add, move, or delete
sections) you must go through all the references by hand and ensure that
they point to the right places.
